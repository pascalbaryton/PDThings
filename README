This is my place to store various things related to SAP PowerDesigner design tool.

Tools / anon
	a Perl script to anonymize PowerDesigner models (stored as XML files),
	e.g. before sending them to technical support

on the drawing board:
DBMS /
	others DBMS
Tools / stable
	a Perl script to minimize the number of differences in PD models
	On save, all XML entities after an added object are renumbered.
	This makes it painful to compare models as XML files.
